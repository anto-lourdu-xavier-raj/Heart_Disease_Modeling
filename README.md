# Heart Disease Modeling

This project leverages cutting-edge machine learning algorithms to analyze heart disease risk factors. By examining datasets, the study identifies critical variables such as blood pressure, age, and smoking, which play a significant role in the prognosis of heart disease. The results emphasize the importance of these factors and provide insights for further investigation in cardiovascular health analytics.

Key Highlights:
Utilized advanced machine learning techniques for cardiovascular risk analysis.
Identified key predictors of heart disease to support early diagnosis and intervention.
Demonstrated the potential of data-driven healthcare solutions in improving patient outcomes.

# I'm excited to present my most recent cardiovascular analysis study! Using cutting-edge machine learning algorithms, my team including Likhithasree Kommineni, Kyle Kane, and I performed a thorough investigation on heart disease risk factors. Professor Kamrul Hasan guided us as we examined datasets to find important factors like blood pressure, age, and smoking. Our results point to the significance of these variables in the prognosis of heart disease and point the way for further investigation. Proud of our teamwork and the knowledge we've acquired. #MachineLearning #HeartDisease #HealthcareAnalytics
